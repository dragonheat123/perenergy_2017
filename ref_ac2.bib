	Abstract                 = {With the promises of smart grids, power can be more efficiently and reliably generated, transmitted, and consumed over conventional electricity systems. Through the two-way flow of information between suppliers and consumers, the grids can also adapt more readily to the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and encourage users' participation in energy savings and cooperation through the demand-response (DR) mechanism. An important issue in smart grids is therefore how to manage DR to reduce peak electricity load and hence future investment in thermal generations and transmission networks, and better utilize renewable energies to reduce our dependence on hydrocarbon. Effective DR depends critically on demand management and price/load/renewable energy forecasting, which call for sophisticated signal processing and optimization techniques. The objectives of this article are to: 1) introduce to the signal processing community the concept of smart grids, especially on the problems of price/load forecasting and DR management (DRM) and optimization, 2) highlight related signal processing applications and state-of-the-art methodologies, and 3) share the authors' research experience through concrete examples on price predictions and DRM and optimization, with emphasis on recursive online solutions and future challenges.},

The model worked well over a wide range of temperatures, 9-38. ??C, making it possible to accurately forecast the electricity load for a variety of demand response applications including operational reserves for renewable energy integration. Individual models are simulated and summed to obtain aggregate forecasts and confidence intervals. The model allows for correlation between the individual shocks that occur in a region. This approach gives substantially more accurate results than the moving average method typically used for forecasting and measuring direct load control. Applying the model to data from three U.S. utilities produced mean square error values from 0.027 to 0.041 with average load values per customer ranging from 0.49 to 0.62. kW. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract                 = {Abstract Selection of input features plays an important role in developing models for short-term load forecasting (STLF). Previous studies along this line of research have focused pre-dominantly on filter and wrapper methods. Given the potential value of a hybrid selection scheme that includes both filter and wrapper methods in constructing an appropriate pool of features, coupled with the general lack of success in employing filter or wrapper methods individually, in this study we propose a hybrid filterâ€“wrapper approach for \{STLF\} feature selection. This proposed approach, which is believed to have taken full advantage of the strengths of both filter and wrapper methods, first uses the Partial Mutual Information based filter method to filter out most of the irrelevant and redundant features, and subsequently applies a wrapper method, implemented via a firefly algorithm, to further reduce the redundant features without degrading the forecasting accuracy. The well-established support vector regression is selected as the modeler to implement the proposed hybrid feature selection scheme. Real-world electricity load datasets from a North-American electric utility and the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 have been used to test the performance of the proposed approach, and the experimental results show its superiority over selected counterparts. },
